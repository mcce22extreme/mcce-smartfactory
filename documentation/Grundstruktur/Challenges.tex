\section{AWS IoT Device Simulator}

It was originally planned to implement the use cases using the AWS IoT Device Simulator. The AWS IoT Device Simulator is a web application that is provided by AWS and is intended to help users or customers to implement IoT projects without physical devices at first. 
The solution helps customers to test the integration of IoT devices with their backend services through an intuitive web-based graphical user interface (GUI). The solution enables customers to create and simulate hundreds of connected devices without having to configure and manage physical devices or develop time-consuming scripts.
Through the virtual representation of IoT devices, simulated data can be generated and real application scenarios can be recreated.

The AWS IoT Device Simulator is provided as an AWS CloudFormation template and can thus be published to the customer's own AWS environment.
 Within the scope of this deployment, various AWS IAM roles and users are also created by the CloudFormation tempalte. Unfortunately, the creation of these resources is not possible in the AWS Lab environment provided to us. For this reason, we decided to implement our own IoT simulator.
